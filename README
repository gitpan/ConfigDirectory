ConfigDirectory-Read and ConfigDirectory-Local

ConfigDirectory::Read provides an interface to easily reading
qmail-style control directories of arbitrary depth.  It includes
functions for accessing data stored in flat files, as well as listing
available "configuration keys".  See the perldoc for more information.

ConfigDirectory::Local provides an interface for recursively
determining configuration.  This means that if a request to read
/path/to/file is generated, and /path/to/file doesn't exist,
/path/file and /file are checked for.  Details are easily controllable
(so that the search doesn't ascend too high, for example).  As always,
RTF perldoc or e-mail me.  Thanks!
